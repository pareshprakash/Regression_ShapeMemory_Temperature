# Transformation-T-NiTi-SMAs
Predicting Martensite transformation temperature in NiTi shape memory alloys using literature data and ML

Here I have attempted to code and analyse by myself a study published in Acta Materialia on the use of ML and
data driven approaches to predict martensite transformation temperature in NiTi shape memory alloys.
Original study can be found at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2016.12.009
